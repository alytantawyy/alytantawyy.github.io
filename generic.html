									<h3>Teaching Assistant for Aleks Program - University Of South Florida</h3>
									<p>In my role as an instructor, I had the opportunity to lead a class of 30 students, where I was responsible for teaching precalculus and calculus 1 concepts in a comprehensive and thorough manner. Beyond traditional teaching, I also actively embraced the role of an academic mentor, striving to provide guidance and support to my students throughout their educational journey. Encouraging student participation and engagement was a fundamental part of my teaching philosophy, and I aimed to create a dynamic and inclusive learning environment. This approach not only welcomed questions and discussions but also actively promoted networking and meaningful peer interactions among the students. The lively and interactive atmosphere that I cultivated in the classroom went beyond the transmission of knowledge; it facilitated a sense of community and camaraderie. This experience taught me valuable lessons about effective communication, adaptability, and the significance of building a supportive learning community within the educational context. Witnessing my students thrive and develop a deeper passion for mathematics was an immensely rewarding experience, solidifying my commitment to education and mentorship.</p>

									<h3>Tutor - University Of South Florida</h3>
									<p>My role as a tutor spanned an array of subjects, encompassing a broad spectrum of academic challenges. It provided me with the opportunity to share my passion for teaching and empower students to excel in their academic pursuits. I offered guidance in subjects ranging from Precalculus, Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Calculus 3, Physics 1, and Physics 2, to more specialized areas like Programming Concepts (Python), Program Design (C), Computer Organization, and Discrete Structures.
Teaching Python, C, C++, and data structures was especially fulfilling. Python's simplicity and versatility made it a great introduction to programming. Introducing students to Python's clean syntax and real-world applications was gratifying. Watching them progress from Python beginners to proficient developers was immensely rewarding.
Teaching C and C++ was uniquely challenging and rewarding. C and C++ are powerful and versatile, serving software development and systems programming. Guiding students through C++ and C, including memory management and object-oriented programming, was intellectually stimulating. Seeing them conquer complexities underscored the importance of logical thinking and precision in coding.
Teaching data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs was both fulfilling and instructive. Data structures are crucial for efficient software development. Teaching these concepts emphasized choosing the right structure and optimizing algorithms. It was rewarding to see students grasp these intricacies and apply them to problem-solving, gaining valuable skills for their academic and professional paths.
These experiences underscored the importance of demystifying complex concepts and empowering students to confidently navigate the world of programming and data structures. It solidified my commitment to sharing knowledge and fostering a deep understanding of these critical areas in computer science.
